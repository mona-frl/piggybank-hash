# [Piggy Bank project developed for my BsC. in Software Engineering]

This is my solution of an assignment for my bachelor degree, where we had to develop a piggy bank using Java, using an abstract class, concepts of polymorph and inheritance.
* On my solution, my idea was to give the feel of a real piggy bank, where we add a currency, and we pull it out the right amount. 
  * To add a currency, you can put any value you think it's right, it will stack up with the other coins.
  * That being said, to remove a currency you have to use the exact amount of the value of a currency displayed on the screen, else you won't be able to remove a currency.
  * When you list the coins, you will be able to see all coins added and at the end of the list, you will get the total of the amount.
  * As part of the assignment, we also had to display all the coins converted to reais (BRL - brazilial Real currency);
